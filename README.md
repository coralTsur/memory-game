In this exercise, a memory game is realized using REACT.

We used the following formula to calculate the player's score:
            (((C^2 * 1000 )/S) * (1/D))
Number of Cards (C): Squaring the number of cards gives it a greater influence on the score.
Number of Steps (S): The score is still inversely proportional to the number of steps.
Delay (D): The score remains inversely proportional to the delay.

This project is part of annual exercises at Hadassah College, done with a colleague Reut Barzilai
